# OpenSeats

## What is OpenSeats?
Open seats is my attempt to recreate software that I use at work every day. I use this website to make reservations for guests who want to use the pool. I can reserve specific seats, make notes for guests, adjust pricing, and cancel reservations.

## Why OpenSeats?
I am recreating this software as an exercise.

## What technologies are being used?
* Go (golang) for a backend web server. It serves as a bridge between the database and the frontend.
* Godot and godot-script for the frontend. I made the 3D models myself as well using Blender.
* MariaDB for the database
* Python for some automation tasks
